# Bike Repositioning Optimization Plan

> Mixed-integer optimization project to improve bike-sharing operations by rebalancing station inventories.  
> Applied to Chicagoâ€™s Divvy dataset with insights for Montrealâ€™s BIXI system.

## ðŸ“Œ TL;DR
- Addresses bike-sharing imbalances (empty/full stations).  
- Uses **data cleaning + visualization** and a **Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)** model.  
- Implemented in Python via **Gurobi** inside Jupyter Notebooks.  
- Two scenarios tested: **Monday morning (7â€“9AM)** and **Wednesday evening (4â€“6PM)**.  
- Produces cost-efficient truck routes and managerial insights.
