# Bike Repositioning Optimization Plan

> Mixed-integer optimization project to improve bike-sharing operations by rebalancing station inventories.  
> Applied to Chicago’s Divvy dataset with insights for Montreal’s BIXI system.

## 📝 Overview
Bike-sharing networks often face asymmetric demand: some stations overflow while others empty. This project applies decision analytics to design a repositioning strategy that minimizes cost while improving service availability. Using Divvy data as a proxy for Montreal’s BIXI, we implemented a truck-routing optimization model in Python with Gurobi. Results show that repositioning needs are highly time-dependent, requiring tailored strategies. Sensitivity analysis highlights cost drivers and informs managerial recommendations.

## 🎯 Objective • Actions • Tasks • Conclusion

**Objective**  
- Alleviate supply–demand mismatch in bike-sharing systems by minimizing costs of truck-based bike repositioning.  

**Actions**  
- Cleaned and merged Divvy datasets.  
- Explored demand patterns by station and time window.  
- Formulated a MIP with capacity, distance, and penalty constraints.  

**Tasks**  
- Built optimization in Python with Gurobi.  
- Modeled 20 busiest stations in two windows (Mon AM, Wed PM).  
- Ran sensitivity analysis on truck fixed costs and deficit penalties.  

**Conclusion**  
- Morning peaks require light repositioning (low cost).  
- Evening peaks demand intensive, costly rebalancing.  
- Recommended strategy: proactive night moves for mornings; targeted guaranteed-service zones for evenings.
